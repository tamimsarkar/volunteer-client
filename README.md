## Volunteer Network
<a href="volunteer-67c35.web.app">click to view</a>
First we need to do create the react app <br />
command - `npx create-react-app` <br />

Install dependencies <br />
command - `npm install react-router-dom firebase react-bootstrap`

building the Homepage <br />

In the HomePage there are mainly 2 sections 
`Header-section
Volunteer Events`
<br />

## Volunteer sections 
onClick of every event changes their route to `apply for a volunteer` route.but that door is closed conditionally.If the user is logged In then it will go through the apply route. 

## Login
I choose firebase for the authentication system.

## Admin :
Admin will filter by his email.He can add new Volunteer event.can see the all of applied application.

Thats all from this repository.
